/**
 * Name: ZIYU TIAN(1284270),  YONGLE CHEN(1347396), JIYANG XIN(1322761)
 * This is the running class for the program.
 * the program modeling the muscle development model,
 * which there is a muscle contains muscle fibers and hormones.
 * the hormones will influence the development of each muscle fibers that all muscle fibers make up the muscle.
 * the hormones will be influenced by daily activities, exercise(lifting in this model), sleep hours, and so on.
 *
 * Instructions to build and run this muscle development model (pass the test in Java SE 19)
 * 1. using terminal and get into the src folder where you can find file Main.java in that folder
 * 2. compile file in terminal by typing: javac .\Main.java
 * 3. run main in terminal by typing: java Main
 * 4. see the output in an output file named: data.csv
 *
 * Include initial value set up for the model in setUp()
 * and the execution of each day for the model in go()
 *
